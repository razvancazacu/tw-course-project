                        large edifice found within Sky Haven Temple.
                        It depicts several events that would preface the return of the Nordic god of
                        destruction, Alduin. The prophecy itself is dire, but scholars believed that its omens had been
                        fulfilled and that a single individual, gifted with the same powers of the Thu'um held by the
                        dragons themselves, may rise to fight against Alduin and assure Nirn's survival. Alduin finally
                        returned in
                        4E 201, during the midst of Skyrim's civil war. Raising an army of dragons from the dead, he
                        attempted to resume his path of destruction. However, he was eventually defeated in a battle by
                        the
                        Last
                        Dragonborn and three ancient Nordic heroes in Sovngarde.</p>

                    <h2>Setting and characters</h2>
                    Skyrim is set around 200 years after the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,although it
                    is not a direct sequel. The game takes place in Skyrim, a province of the Empire on the continent
                    of Tamriel, amid a civil war between two factions: the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak, and
                    the Imperial Legion, led by General Tullius. The player character is a Dragonborn, a mortal born
                    with the soul and power of a dragon. Alduin, a large black dragon who returns to the land after
                    being lost in time, serves as the game's primary antagonist. Alduin is the first dragon created by
                    Akatosh, one of the series' gods, and is prophesied to destroy man and consume the world.

                    <h3>Plot</h3>
                    The player character is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen overseen by General
                    Tullius, which includes Ulfric Stormcloak among the prisoners to be executed there. Alduin
                    unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The
                    player escapes in the chaos and journeys to the city of Whiterun to request aid against the dragon
                    threat. After slaying a dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs its soul, which grants them
                    the ability to perform a shout. The city's amazed guards inform the player that they must be
                    Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in
                    seclusion on Skyrim's tallest mountain, the Throat of the World. The Greybeards train the player in
                    using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that
                    Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls,
                    which also predicted the return of Alduin.
                    <br><br>
                    The player later meets with members of the Blades, an order of dragon hunters. The player and the
                    Blades travel to Sky Haven Temple to find a prophetic engravement on Alduin's Wall and learn that
                    ancient Nords used a special shout against Alduin so they could engage him. To gain more
                    information, the player meets the ancient dragon Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards.
                    Paarthurnax reveals that Alduin was cast into the currents of time by the use of an Elder Scroll in
                    the hope that he would never reemerge. The player locates the Elder Scroll and uses it to peer
                    through a window in time and learn the shout to combat Alduin. The player battles with Alduin, who
                    then flees to Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, to gain strength by devouring the souls of deceased
                    Nords.
                    <br><br>
                    The player summons and traps a dragon named Odahviing, and learns from him that Alduin has fled to
                    Sovngarde through a portal located at an ancient fort called Skuldafn. Odahviing agrees to fly the
                    player to Skuldafn, claiming Alduin has shown himself as weak and undeserving of leadership over
                    the dragon race by fleeing from the Dragonborn. The player enters Sovngarde and travels to the Hall
                    of Valor. There, they meet up with the three heroes of Nordic legend who defeated Alduin
                    originally. With their help, the player defeats Alduin once and for all.
